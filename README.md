`gotests` generates Go test functions from the given source code.

Given `A.go` file, it analyzes test functions in `A_test.go` and adds functions which are not defined in that file. For example, if a function `DoSomething()` is defined in `A.go` but `TestDoSomething()` is not in `A_test.go`, it adds that function to `A_test.go`. By default, it only checks the exported functions (its name starts with upper case). Given a directory, it operates on all `*.go` files in that directory. By default, `gotests` prints the updated test sources to standard output.

I hope this tool would be a new friend of Gophers like `gofmt` or `gorename`. 

## Editor

`gotests` works well with your favorite editor like `gofmt` does. The following demo shows using `gotests` from Emacs. The left display shows the source codes and the right shows test source codes. It generates and adds test functions on the right codes,

`gotests.el` used by this demo is in [`editor/emacs`](/editor/emacs) directory (I'm not good at emacs plugin development. So this plugin should not well written. If you are good at emacs plugin please send PR ðŸ™‡ ).

A plugin PR for the other editor is welcome.
